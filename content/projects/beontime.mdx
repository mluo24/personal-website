This mobile app was made for the <Link href="https://www.cornellappdev.com/courses/hack-challenge" target="_blank">AppDev Hack Challenge</Link>.
Its purpose is for Cornell students to keep track of their courses and their respective assignments/tasks to simplify Canvas calendar and give more information than other traditional todo apps.

I worked on the backend, an API made with Flask and the SQLAlchemy ORM, which offers authentication via Bearer token, various endpoints to add courses/assignments/tasks,
and utilizes the <Link href="https://classes.cornell.edu/content/SP22/api-details" target="_blank">Cornell Course Roster API</Link> to get all the up-to-date courses for the semester.
