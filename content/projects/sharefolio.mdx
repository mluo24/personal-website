This project started off as making a Wattpad-esque app, but it has now changed to focusing on sharing creative works in general (a portfolio) and the community providing constructive feedback.
The idea was partially inspired by how I would frequently create works where I feel I would benefit receiving feedback.

Currently, the app supports chaptered fiction, which provided interesting insights into database model relations, as well as other ideas like "liking," bookmarking, word count, WSYIWYG editors, comments, and tagging.
As of 2021, I have extended it to use Django Rest Framework and making the <Link href="https://github.com/mluo24/sharefolio-frontend" target="_blank">frontend</Link> in React.
