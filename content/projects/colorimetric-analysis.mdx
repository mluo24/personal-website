This project won an honorable mention in computing awards at the NJ Regional Science Fair. My partner and I wanted to find exact concentrations of solutions without a spectrophotometer using semi-quantitative educational test kits.

We experimented with phosphorus solutions and developed it through generated absorbance curves with a spectrophotometer and smartphone pictures of solutions made with the test kit in a semi-controlled lighting setting,
and essentially modeled it with linear regression using Beer-Lambert's law to associate RGB values to absorbance and therefore concentration. Feel free to view our <Link href="https://njrsf.org/cgi-bin/DisplayAbstract.pl?Project=CM.04&Yr=2019" target="_blank">abstract</Link>.
