This has been ongoing throughout high school (2016-2020), with each iteration improving from before and changing the fields for the game,
developed for my school's robotics team, <Link href="https://team1676.com/" underline="hover" target="_blank">Team 1676: The Pascack Pi-Oneers</Link>, for team members to record
information on robots and analyze it for strategic purposes. This was my first basis for web development, learning new tech stacks, working on a dev project with a team, leadership, and managing a long-term project.

The 2020 specific version, in terms of technical changes, has a new UI that looks like the game field when rendered for ease of data input when scouting live games.
The data querying was not worked upon due to the pandemic, but previous methods such as team comparisons and simple <Link href="https://datatables.net/" target="_blank">DataTables</Link> views are still possible.
