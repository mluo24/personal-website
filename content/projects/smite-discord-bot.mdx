This is my latest project, and it is a Discord bot that utilizes the public API of <Link href="https://www.smitegame.com/" target="_blank">Smite</Link>, a free-to-play cross platform MOBA.
The features are currently still in development, but our goal is to include player data lookup and game mechanic lookups (gods, items, relics, etc), perfect for a Smite-oriented Discord server.
