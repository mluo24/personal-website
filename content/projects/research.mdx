This was a project meant for data gathering for the research project, <em>Bioinformatics of Kinases to Elucidate the Evolution of Cell Signaling</em>, to hold data collected from BLAST databases.
for the purpose of tracking cell signaling evolution of many organisms with the protein kinases of an <em>Arabidopsis</em> model organism.

It is a basic CRUD app made with basic PHP and manually making connections to a database, and all the data can be viewed and exported easily based on what was needed for the graphs at the end of the project.
