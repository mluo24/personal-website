This was my final project for CS 3110: Functional Programming. The original game idea was for a Stardew Valley-esque game of a life simulator passing through each day doing tasks, but with the life of a Cornell student.

We used the OCaml graphics library and camlimages to create a robust tile/map engine to generate maps from spritesheets with a JSON, as well as layers for collision/interaction of items/map warps. Instead of passing time, we had a limited step counter and calculated a "GPA" at the end based on actions performed in the game.
