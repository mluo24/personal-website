This is my subteam on DTI, and what I have been focused on since joining DTI in Fall 2021. "Zing" is actually comprised of two products:
"Zing", which intelligently groups students, and Zing-LSC, which the Learning Strategies Center uses to pair students with study buddies.

Some features I have implemented include a match button in connection to the backend API for Zing-LSC, a group "export to CSV button" for Zing,
and upgrades to the MUI version and the React component library for both sides.
