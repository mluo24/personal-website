This was the final project for the course <Link href="https://webdev.cornelldti.org/" target="_blank">Trends in Web Development</Link>.

The purpose of this project is for people who want to make rather short-term personal projects and need to enlist other people to help them. This was my first project using the Node, Express, React, and NoSQL stack, and the repo is a monorepo taking advantage of yarn workspaces and using the same packages.
Planned features include a chat and user rating system.
